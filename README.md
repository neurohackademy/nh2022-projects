**Description of project**: Our project aims to explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying encoding and recognition (familiarity) memory processes. To this end, we have begun analzying data from the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD). We aim to analyze behavioral performance using signal detection approaches to characterize memory function and associated effects on reaction times. We are also conducting task-based analyses including functional connectivity (using resting state to test our framework) and multivariate classification using linear support vector machines and convolutional neural networks. ROIs of interest include hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and whole brain data.\
**How to get involved**: To-date, we have used a branching workflow. You may access the public GitHub repository (listed above), clone it, contribute and initiate a pull request to merge your changes into the main analysis pipeline.

### Ni-ght-MARE
**Project url(s)**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/PTDZ/Ni-ght-MARE)\
**Contributors**: [Patrycja Dzianok](https://github.com/PTDZ)\
**Description of project**: A step-by-step pipeline for using NiMARE Python package for neuroimaging meta-analysis. The project shows functionality of NiMARE and sample (basic/undergoing) meta-analysis results of fMRI studies regarding dementia. Additionally, during the Neurohackademy I created a list ([SORTED](https://github.com/PTDZ/SORTED)) of interesting neuroscience ideas, tools and links (the idea was born out of Slack discussions with other participants) that will (hopefully) be updated on an ongoing basis and can serve neuroscience community (especially MSc/PhD students and postdocs).\

### nsdfsavg
**Project url(s)**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/ana-nv/nsd_fsavg)\
**Contributors**: [Ana Arsenovic](https://github.com/ana-nv)\
**Description of project**: The goal of this project is to investigate the reliability of Freesurfer outputs in individual subjects in the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD; [Allen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00962-x)). The dataset contains in total 8 subjects with multiple 0.8 mm T1 acquisitions each (ranging from 4 to 10). NSD Data Manual is available [here](https://cvnlab.slite.com/p/CT9Fwl4_hc/NSD-Data-Manual).\

### Paranormal-events
**Name**: Paranormal-events\
**Project url(s)**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/jahchwe/nh-paranoia.git)\
**Contributors**: [John Andrew Chwe](https://github.com/hjweric), [Ana Fouto](https://github.com/anarfouto), [Jiawen Huang](https://github.com/hjweric), [Clara Sava-Segal](https://github.com/csavasegal)\
**Description of project**: Previous research have shown a link between individual variations in brain activity to clinical traits [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04387-2). For example, individuals that shared clinical traits should process information more similarly. Researchers examined trait level paranoia in this [dataset](https://gin.g-node.org/ljchang/Paranoia) and then had individuals listen to a paranoid-inducing scenario in the scanner, finding that persons with comparable degrees of trait level paranoia processed information in similar ways. This study served as a proof of concept that clinical traits could be linked to neural information processing. There is also evidence that participants chunk continuous stimuli into discrete chunks, and recent algorithms can model the switching between event states. In this project, we aimed to apply such techniques to assess whether clinical traits can be linked to event segmentation, such that individuals more similar in trait paranoia demonstrate more similar event boundaries.\

**Description of project**: AOMIC-ID1000 contains about 1000 subjects which have done a video viewing task. They have 
fMRI signals, T1w images, physiology data and a battery of tests outside the scanner. We have two aims. One is to predict 
the audio features from fMRI and anatomical features. Other is to predict out-of-scanner scores. \
